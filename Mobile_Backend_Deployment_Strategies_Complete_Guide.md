## Introduction to Deployment Strategies

### What are Deployment Strategies?
Deployment strategies are systematic approaches to releasing new versions of applications and services with minimal downtime and risk. They enable teams to deploy updates safely while maintaining system availability and user experience.

### Why Use Advanced Deployment Strategies?
```yaml
# Benefits
- Zero or minimal downtime
- Reduced deployment risk
- Faster rollback capabilities
- Better user experience
- Improved testing in production
- Gradual feature rollout
- Performance monitoring
- A/B testing capabilities
```

### Deployment Strategy Types
```yaml
# Strategy Categories
1. Canary Deployment: Gradual rollout to small user groups
2. Blue-Green Deployment: Instant switch between environments
3. Rolling Deployment: Incremental updates across instances
4. A/B Testing: Statistical comparison of versions
5. Feature Flags: Runtime feature toggling
6. Shadow Deployment: Parallel testing without user impact
```

---

## Canary Deployment

### What is Canary Deployment?
Canary deployment is a strategy where new software versions are released to a small subset of users (the "canary") before rolling out to the entire user base. This allows for early detection of issues and performance monitoring.

### How Canary Deployment Works
```yaml
# Canary Deployment Flow
1. Deploy new version to canary environment
2. Route small percentage of traffic to canary
3. Monitor performance and error rates
4. Gradually increase traffic percentage
5. Full rollout or rollback based on metrics
6. Complete deployment to all users
```

### Canary Deployment Architecture

#### 1. Load Balancer Configuration
```yaml
# Traffic Distribution
Initial Canary: 1-5% of traffic
Expansion Phase: 10-25% of traffic
Wide Release: 50-75% of traffic
Full Release: 100% of traffic

# Load Balancer Rules
- Health check endpoints
- Traffic splitting algorithms
- Session affinity considerations
- Geographic distribution
```

#### 2. Canary Environment Setup
```yaml
# Environment Configuration
Canary Environment:
  - Identical to production
  - Same data sources
  - Monitoring and logging
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Performance baselines

# Infrastructure Requirements
- Separate deployment pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting
- Database compatibility
- Cache synchronization
- Service mesh configuration
```

### Canary Deployment Implementation

#### 1. Backend Service Canary
```yaml
# Service Mesh Configuration (Istio)
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  hosts:
  - backend-service
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: backend-service
        subset: stable
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: backend-service
        subset: canary
      weight: 10
```

#### 2. Mobile App Canary
```yaml
# App Store Connect Configuration

{
  "name": "canary-routing",
  "config": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "condition": "header.user-id ends_with '0'",
        "upstream": "new-version-service"
      },
      {
        "condition": "default",
        "upstream": "stable-version-service"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Canary Deployment Metrics

## Blue-Green Deployment

### What is Blue-Green Deployment?
Blue-green deployment is a strategy where two identical production environments (blue and green) are maintained. The blue environment runs the current version while the green environment runs the new version. Traffic is switched from blue to green once the new version is validated.

### Blue-Green Deployment Architecture

#### 1. Environment Setup
```yaml
# Environment Configuration
Blue Environment (Production):
  - Current stable version
  - Full production traffic
  - Production database
  - Production monitoring

Green Environment (Staging):
  - New version to deploy
  - No production traffic
  - Staging database (or production copy)
  - Staging monitoring
```

#### 2. Database Strategy
```yaml
# Database Approaches
1. Shared Database:
   - Both environments use same database
   - Schema compatibility required
   - No data migration needed
   - Risk of data corruption

2. Database Copy:
   - Green environment uses database copy
   - Data migration required
   - No production data risk
   - Longer deployment time

3. Database Migration:
   - Forward-compatible schema changes
   - Backward-compatible rollback
   - Zero-downtime migrations
   - Complex implementation
```

### Blue-Green Deployment Implementation

#### 1. Load Balancer Configuration
```yaml
# Traffic Switching
Before Switch:
  - Blue: 100% traffic
  - Green: 0% traffic

During Switch:
  - Blue: 0% traffic
  - Green: 100% traffic

After Switch:
  - Blue: 0% traffic (standby)
  - Green: 100% traffic (production)
```

#### 2. Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
# Deployment Steps
1. Deploy to Green Environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Run integration tests
4. Run performance tests
5. Validate business metrics
6. Switch traffic to Green
7. Monitor Green environment
8. Decommission Blue environment
```

#### 3. Infrastructure as Code
```terraform
# Terraform Configuration
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "blue" {
  name     = "blue-target-group"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "green" {
  name     = "green-target-group"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_lb_listener" "main" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.main.arn
  port              = "80"
  protocol          = "HTTP"

  default_action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.green.arn
  }
}
```

  }

  private hashUserId(userId: string): number {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < userId.length; i++) {
      hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + userId.charCodeAt(i);

    const profile = await this.newProfileAPI.getProfile(userId);
    return this.transformToUserProfile(profile);
  }

  private async getLegacyUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> {
    // Legacy implementation
    return this.legacyProfileAPI.getProfile(userId);
  }
}

## Monitoring & Rollback Strategies

### Monitoring Strategies

#### 1. Key Metrics Monitoring
```yaml
# Technical Metrics
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- Database performance
- Cache hit rates

# Business Metrics
- User engagement
- Conversion rates
- Revenue impact
- User satisfaction
- Feature adoption
- Support volume
```

#### 2. Real-time Monitoring
```yaml
# Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus + Grafana
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- CloudWatch
- DataDog
- New Relic
- Custom dashboards

# Alerting
- Automated alerts
- Escalation procedures
- On-call rotations
- Incident response
- Post-mortem analysis
```

### Rollback Strategies

#### 1. Automated Rollback
```yaml
# Rollback Triggers
- High error rates (>5%)
- Performance degradation (>2x baseline)
- Health check failures
- Business metric drops
- Security alerts
- User complaints

# Rollback Actions
- Traffic routing changes
- Service restart
- Configuration rollback
- Database rollback
- Feature flag disable
```

#### 2. Manual Rollback
```yaml
# Rollback Procedures
1. Assess situation
2. Determine rollback scope
3. Execute rollback plan
4. Verify rollback success
5. Monitor post-rollback
6. Communicate to stakeholders
7. Plan next steps
```

### Rollback Implementation

#### 1. Canary Rollback
```yaml
# Rollback Process
1. Reduce canary traffic to 0%
2. Route all traffic to stable version
3. Investigate issues
4. Fix problems
5. Redeploy canary
6. Resume gradual rollout
```

#### 2. Blue-Green Rollback
```yaml
# Rollback Process
1. Switch traffic back to Blue
2. Investigate Green issues
3. Fix problems in Green
4. Redeploy to Green
5. Test Green environment
6. Switch traffic back to Green
```
